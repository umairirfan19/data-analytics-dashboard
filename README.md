# Automated Testing and Reporting System

## 📌 Overview
This project automates data validation and reporting workflows using **Python**, **SQL**, and **VBA**.  
It reduces manual testing effort, improves accuracy, and provides automated reporting for stakeholders.

## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ Automated test scripts in Python to validate data pipelines  
- ✅ SQL queries for database testing and result verification  
- ✅ VBA-powered reporting tool that generates summarized reports  
- ✅ Defect logging and documentation following QA best practices  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, VBA  
- **Tools & Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, MS Excel  
- **Concepts:** QA Automation, Data Validation, Reporting  

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Data is pulled and validated using Python scripts  
2. SQL queries cross-check pipeline results  
3. Automated reports are generated in Excel with VBA  
4. Defects and issues are logged for reproducibility
